Introduction:

Customer churn poses significant challenges to subscription-based businesses, leading to revenue losses and brand reputation damage. Predicting churn enables proactive retention strategies, enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty. This project aims to develop a predictive model using historical customer data to identify subscribers likely to churn.

Description:

This project involves designing and implementing a machine learning model to predict customer churn for subscription-based services. The model leverages historical customer data, including:

- Usage behavior (login frequency, time spent, feature adoption)
- Customer demographics (age, location, plan type)
- Subscription information (tenure, payment method, plan changes)

The objective is to develop an accurate and reliable churn prediction model, enabling businesses to identify high-risk customers, implement targeted retention strategies, improve customer satisfaction and loyalty, and reduce revenue losses.
